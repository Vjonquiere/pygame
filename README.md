## Documentation

 **What's the goal ?**
 To win you have to colide all the red balls (you can change the difficulty by modifying the objective in the Main screen) but each time you colide a ball it turns into a blue ball. If you touch a blue ball you lose, so the game is easy with 5 balls but harder with 10 balls

 **Play:**

 - Launch Title_screen.py
 - Set an objective (max 100) and a number of player (max 2)
 - Let's Play !
 
**Controls:**
 - 1 player:
Use arrows to control the player
 - 2 players:
 One player use arrow to control his player and the other use ZQSD
